Hello, this is a test for the repository. 

If you want to add changes to the repository from the terminal, follow these steps:

1. git add .
2. git commit -m "PLACE A COMMENT ABOUT THE CHANGE YOU MADE"
3. git push

On the GitHub app, just make your changes on whatever platform you want and then go to "Uncommited Changes" in the app to add your comment and push
